  "description": "This object is derived from the DAPT study that aimed to identify the risk of benefit vs. harm for patients that continue thienopyridine treatment beyond one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This objects input is a dictionary containing risk values for 12 different risk factors. It will then calculate the estimated risk of MI/stent thrombosis in the 12-30 month period post PCI using the following formula: RISK = 1 - S(18)^exp(sum of [coefficient * risk factor values] - sum) .",
